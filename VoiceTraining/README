This directory should include an AcousticModels, Profiles and TrainingModel directory, recordAudio.py, training_script.py, bw, cmudict-en-us.dict, en-us.lm.bin, map_adapt and this README.

Dependencies:
    sudo apt-get install -qq python python-dev python3-pip build-essential swig libpulse-dev
    #sudo apt install sox used for play command in linux
    pip3 install pydub
    pip3 install ffprobe
    pip install sounddevice
    pip install scipy
    pip install playsound #works with vscode but doesnt close out of wavfile right away
    pip install pydub #works with vscode and closes out properly after playing
    
    There might be some that I forgot to note down.
    
How to use training programs:
    1. Execute recordAudio.py
    2. Give the relative path to the training set
       This is in TrainingModel/*
       Example: TrainingModel/test
    3. Give the filename of the fileids and transcription file without extension name.
       Example: test
    4. Follow the prompts on screen.
       After recording the voice lines, it saves them as wav files in the directory of the training set.
    5. Execute training_script.py
    6. Follow the prompts on screen.
       After execution, the personalized language model is created in the AcousticModels directory with specified name.
    
How to use language model in application (temporary):
    1. Go into the AcousticModels directory and copy the language model you want to use.
    2. Go into Profiles/en-US and paste the model into there.
    3. Delete the acoustic-model folder that was already in there
    4. Rename the new model to acoustic-model
