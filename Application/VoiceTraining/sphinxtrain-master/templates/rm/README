Resource Management "from scratch" training/testing setup
---------------------------------------------------------

To use this template, first create a directory for training, then use
the setup_SphinxTrain.pl script to copy the template to it (please
replace /path/to/SphinxTrain with the actual path to your SphinxTrain
installation):

mkdir /somewhere/RM1
cd /somewhere/RM1
/path/to/SphinxTrain/scripts/setup_SphinxTrain.pl -template rm

This setup relies on having the RM1 corpus, LDC catalog number
LDC93S3B, in a locally accessible directory.  Since this originally
shipped on a number of CDs, to which you may or may not have access,
you should edit the file etc/rm1_files.cfg to point to the
subdirectories where the RM1 files are located.  Specific directories
and files required are listed in files.txt.

Basically, you need to have the doc, dep, ind, dep_trn and ind_trn
directories from the original release.  Case of the filenames should
not be important.

In order for the scripts included here to work, you must have Festival
and the Perl scripts and binaries from cmuclmtk in your $PATH.  If you
don't want to install them systemwide, then you can do it like this
(replacing /path/to/cmuclmtk with the full path to wherever the source
tree for it resides):

export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/cmuclmtk/bin:/path/to/cmuclmtk/perl"

or, for those of you who still insist on using csh:

setenv PATH "$PATH:/path/to/cmuclmtk/bin:/path/to/cmuclmtk/perl"

Now, you will be able to generate all the files needed for training.
You need to run (please replace /path/to/SphinxTrain with the actual
path to your SphinxTrain installation):

perl scripts/create_transcripts.pl
perl scripts/extract_features.pl
perl scripts/create_dictionary.pl -c /path/to/SphinxTrain/test/res/cmudict.0.6d
perl scripts/make_phoneset.pl etc/rm.dic etc/rm.filler > etc/rm.phone

Finally, you should be able to do basic training:

sphinxtrain run
